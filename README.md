# Digital-Dial-Up
Some project I'm working on that attempts to encode and decode files using audio data like how dial up did, hence the name "Digital Dial-Up".

# Limits
Every program has it's limits, whether it be an open-world sandbox game like Minecraft with it's world generation limits, or an Emulator like 86Box with limits on how much RAM a certain machine and motherboard type can use. This program also has it's limits. As the program is still in a rather unpolished state. Some of the limitations are that the program are that it is unoptimized, so for example, an 845KB png takes over 12 hours to fully complete in my experience as of Revision #8.

# Requirements
This program as far as I can tell only works on Microsoft Windows and Linux, since I haven't tested it on MacOS. Anyway, it requires ffmpeg.exe and ffprobe.exe, as for python script, here are the commands you need to run: 
pip install pydub
pip install numpy
The version of python needed is 3.9 or above.

# Instructions
To run the script, open a terminal/command prompt/powershell and run either dial-cli.py or .\dial-cli.py, then follow the onscreen instructions.
